# Introduction to Web Dev Workshop
:wave: Welcome to Code Future's intro to web dev workshop! This lesson is organized into :three: parts meant to highlight the main features of HTML. The goal is to showcase how a markup language can be used to create simple display content on the web. Follow along the comments on each part, they will guide you through teaching the lesson. :smile:

### Final Product
If you're curious, here is what you will be building with your students. It's fairly simple, but we cover a lot of important ground along the way. :gem:

## Get setup with repl
You should follow along our code through GitHub. But, you will be teachingt the lesson through repl because it provides a simpler interface for both you and the student to write and run HTML. Here's how to get setup and have the students follow along:
1. Go to https://replit.com/ **in a separate window**
    - Screenshare your repl window through Zoom for the students to follow along. It is important your GitHub and repl are in two separate windows so only the repl is screenshared.
2. Sign in to repl with your GitHub account. Students, who most likely do not have a GitHub, can use their Google account to signup. If they do not have a Google account, they may use their parent's.
3. Once logged in, click the **+** button under the "Create" heading
    - Select HTML, CSS, JS as your language
    - Name the project "My first website" for the students to copy
4. Click "Create repl"
5. Once the repl has opened, delete the style.css and script.js files. Keep index.html
6. To load the HTML whenever you update it, click the "RUN" button

## Access Part 1 of the lesson
If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, you are currently in the "final" branch which contains all of the code compiled in this lesson. To switch branches, click on the dropdown menu labelled "final" to the left just above all of the files. Follow the instructions you see in Part 1 to begin the lesson.
