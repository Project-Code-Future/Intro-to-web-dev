A showcase of divs, buttons, styles (and a bit of JavaScript)

## Notes

2. Use the below HTML code for the button below when you get to the onclick function in line 41 of index.html

### Below is the button code for line 41 in index.html
```html
<button onclick="document.getElementById('myID').innerText = 'My button was clicked!'" id="this">Click me!</button>
```
