# Initial setup

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
    <meta name="description" content="Your first website"/>

    <title>Intro to Web Dev</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Before you code...
Explain what HTML is used for - creating websites - and it is built on "tags" for headings, paragraphs, etc.
Let the students know they can ignore the head tag and everything inside it because it will not affect what they see in the browser.

## Instructions
1. Copy in the base template provided above
2. Open this GitHub repo's index.html file
3. Read the first lines of comments (about body tags and browsers)
    a. Treat this like a script, but you definitely don't need to follow word for word
4. Read the next few comments and paste in the code they refer to, in this case the h1 tag
5. Copy in the next block of code and explain using the points in the chunk of comments
6. Keep going until you've completed all the comment + block pairs
    a. Please add your own thoughts and clarifications as you go along :)
7. Answer questions along the way, save time at the end to clarify anything
8. When you're done with Part 1, move on to Part 2 by switching branches. Here's how to do that in GitHub:
