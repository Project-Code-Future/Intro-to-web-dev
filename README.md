# Part 3
A showcase of divs, buttons, styles (and a bit of JavaScript)

## Notes
1. Add the code from this lesson below your code from Part 2, still inside the body tag
2. Use the below HTML code for the button below when you get to the comments about the onclick function

Below is the button code for Part 3
```html
<button onclick="document.getElementById('myID').innerText = 'My button was clicked!'" id="this">Click me!</button>
```
