    <!-- Div tags act as "boxes" that hold HTML inside of them -->
    <!-- Div tags are harder to understand becuase you can't see them naturally -->
    <div>
      <p>My first div</p>
    </div>
    <!-- CSS - "Cascading Style Sheets" - is how you style your website -->
    <!-- You usually put CSS in a separate file, it is kind of a separate lanuage,
         but it can be written inside of HTML -->
    <!-- Let's add CSS inside our previous div with the style attribute-->
    <div style="border: 1px solid blue;">
      <p>My first div</p>
    </div>
    <!-- This creates a border of 1 pixel width, solid filling, and blue color. Now you can see the div! -->

    <!-- Let's add CSS to other elements, particularly h1 -->
    <h1>This is a normal heading</h1>
    <h1 style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">This is a normal heading with a new font</h1>
    <h1 style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; color: green;">
      Now I'm green!
    </h1>

    <!-- Button tags create buttons in HTML which can be clicked -->
    <!-- Any HTML element can technically be clicked, but buttons are the best -->
    <button></button>

    <!-- The onlick attribute is how you control what the button does,
         it takes a JavaScript function -->
    <!-- Simply paste in the onclick attribute provided in the README.md file -->
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('myID').innerText = 'My button was clicked!'" id="this">Click me!</button>
    <!-- Click the button, notice onclick will not do anything...yet -->

    <!-- onclick is looking for an element with id: "myId". -->
    <!-- ID's are a way to name HTML elements so they can be selected in code -->
    <!-- Let's create a p that has an id attribute of "myid" and we'll put it inside another div -->
    <div style="border: 1px solid red;">
      <p id="myID">My second div</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Now when they click the button, it will change the text inside this div -->
    
    <!-- Give 10 minutes for students to play around with the divs, add new buttons, and change id selectors -->
